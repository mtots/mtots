# TODO

Some things I really wanna get around to

* Allow more than 256 constants in a single thunk.
  Given that identifiers also count as constants...
  It's quite easy to hit this limit.
  I find myself putting this off because I really don't want to touch
  that code again, but I will probably have to come back at some point.
