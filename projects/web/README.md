`make-web.py` will use `minimal-modified.html` as the shell file.

This shell file contains just the raw canvas image optimal for hosting
on itch.io

`minimal.html` taken verbatim from
https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/main/src/shell_minimal.html

`minimal-modified.html` is a modified version of `minimal.html` that removes
the borders so that they will fit exactly on itch.io
